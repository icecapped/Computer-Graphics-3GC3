# Computer Graphics 3GC3
## Overview
Assignments for McMaster Software Engineering 3GC3: Computer Graphics. The assignments include some tweaks and features from me messing around with OpenGL.

### Assignment 1: Solar System Simulation
Small demo focused on the basics of OpenGL (shaders, transformations, buffers, linear algebra for graphics.)

Tweaks:
- Added ability to move camera around using wasdqe
- Added hotkeys for switching focus between sun/earth/moon (1, 2, 3)
- Plan to add:
  - time multiplier adjustment on some other keys
